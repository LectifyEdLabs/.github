# Lectify

**Textbooks shouldn't be silent.**

Education should be effortless. At Lectify, we turn textbooks and complex materials into smart, AI-generated video lessons — clear, concise, and made just for you. Any subject, any language, any time. Learning, reimagined.

## Coming Soon

We are preparing our next body of work — research, open-source tools, and applied projects at the intersection of AI and education.

If you are an independent researcher, educator, or builder working in this space and are interested in collaborating, we would be glad to hear from you.
